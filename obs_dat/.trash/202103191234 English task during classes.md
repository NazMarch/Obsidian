I have seen a modern house with gray panel walls. There is a white glossy floor that was made of tile.
I can see a cup of water
I have seen an iron bunker and nothing else
I have seen a garden of apple trees
I go into the door
I have seen a small lake with clean water. I don't want to cross the lake
