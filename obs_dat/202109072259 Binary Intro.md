Trees provide moderate access/search 
==*quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays*.==  

Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion 
==*quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists*==

Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees don’t have an upper limit on 
number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.  
Main applications of trees include:   
1. Manipulate hierarchical data.   
2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal).   
3. Manipulate sorted lists of data.   
4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects.   
5. Router algorithms   
6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).   
Binary Tree: A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.   
Binary Tree Representation in C: A tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in tree. If the tree is empty, then value of root is NULL.   

A Tree node contains following parts.   
1. Data   
2. Pointer to left child   
3. Pointer to right child

In a Binary Tree with N nodes, 
minimum possible height or the  minimum number of levels is? 
==**Log2(N+1) **==

**A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least  ==|Log2L?|+ 1==   levels**
